# Customer Retention Intelligence System
 
Predicting and explaining customer churn for a retail bank — built to support
proactive retention decisions, not just generate a model score.

## Business Problem
 
This bank loses ~20% of its customers annually. Each lost customer represents
an estimated €5,000 in lifetime value, while a retention outreach costs ~€150.
Currently there is no system to flag at-risk customers before they leave.
 
## What This Solves
 
A risk-scoring system that:
- Ranks all customers by churn probability
- Explains *why* each customer is at risk (not just a black-box score)
- Is tuned around the actual cost of false positives/negatives, not generic accuracy
## Key Findings (from EDA)
 
- Customers in **Germany churn at ~32%** vs ~16% in France/Spain — despite similar profiles
- **Inactive members churn at nearly 2x** the rate of active ones
- Counter-intuitively, customers holding **3-4 products churn more** than those with 1-2,
  suggesting over-selling rather than loyalty from cross-sell
## Approach
 
1. EDA to find behavioral drivers of churn (not just feature correlation)
2. Random Forest classifier, 5-fold cross-validated (ROC-AUC: 0.86)
3. **Threshold tuned to maximize estimated retention value**, not accuracy —
   moving from the default 0.5 cutoff to the business-optimal threshold improved
   estimated annual value by ~€[X]
4. SHAP explainability so each flagged customer comes with a reason, not just a score
5. Deployed as a Streamlit tool with single-lookup and bulk CSV scoring
## Results
 
| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| ROC-AUC | 0.86 |
| Precision @ business threshold | 0.XX |
| Recall @ business threshold | 0.XX |
| Estimated annual retention value | €XX,XXX |
 
## Two Interfaces, One Model
 
- **Streamlit app** — for the data/risk team: individual customer lookups, SHAP-based explanations, bulk scoring
- **Power BI dashboard** — for leadership/retention ops: portfolio-level financial exposure, risk concentration by segment, an interactive what-if retention ROI simulator, and Power BI's Key Influencers AI visual for plain-language churn drivers
This mirrors how ML and BI teams typically split responsibilities in industry — the model's scored output feeds both a technical tool and a business-facing dashboard.
 
## Tech Stack
 
Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · SHAP · Streamlit
 
## How to Run
 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
 
## What I'd Do With More Time
 
- A/B test the actual retention offers to validate the 30% assumed save rate
- Add a time-series component — churn risk likely changes month to month, not static
- Integrate directly with a CRM via API instead of CSV upload
